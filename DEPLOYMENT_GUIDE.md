# 🚀 Focus & Smile 2.2 - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Extension Ready for Chrome Web Store!

Your extension has passed all quality checks and is production-ready.

## 📦 Building for Production

### Quick Deploy
```bash
npm run package
```
This will create an optimized build in the `dist/` folder.

### Manual Build Steps
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production (optimized, no console logs)
npm run build:prod

# Or regular build
npm run build
```

## 📁 What Gets Built

The `dist/` folder contains your complete extension:
```
dist/
├── manifest.json          # Extension manifest
├── index.html            # Popup HTML
├── popup.js              # Main app bundle (IIFE format)
└── icons/                # All extension icons
    ├── icon16.png        # Toolbar icon
    ├── icon48.png        # Extension management
    └── icon128.png       # Chrome Web Store
```

## 🔧 MIME Type Issue - RESOLVED ✅

The previous "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script" error has been fixed:
- **Updated build configuration** to use IIFE format
- **Removed ES module dependencies** for Chrome extension compatibility
- **Proper script loading** without module type declarations
- **Chrome extension optimized** build process
